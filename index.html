    <p>Happy Valentines My Love! 
      <br>
      I made this website just for you!
      <br>
       You keep me going a lot of the time and I am ever so thankful to
      have you as MY girlfriend.<br>
       We clicked from the very first time that we met and from them I've been yours.<br>

      Im so happy to have such a beautiful, kind, loving girl!
      <br>
       You have helped me get through toughest days at university, and now I'd like to use what I've learnt
      for this site! 
      <br>Click on your name... See what happens!
